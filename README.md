# minimum-spanning-tree

In this project, we will implement Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms over a particular type of graph, in which nodes represent cities on a map, and edges are drawn between nearby cities. Adjacencies are not determined by road connections, but instead by their distance; more precisely, two cities are considered adjacent if their geodesic distance is smaller than a certain maximal value. The weight of each edge is given by the geodesic distance between the pair of cities it connects. You will be asked to implement two classical algorithms, Kruskal’s algorithm and Prim’s algorithm, in order to find the minimum spanning tree in each of the connected component of the graph of cities, minimizing the cost of the tree with respect to the given edge weights.
